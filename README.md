# TurnUpPortal212 â€“ UI Test Automation (C# Â· Selenium Â· NUnit)

This repository contains automated UI tests for the TurnUp Portal using **C#**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **NUnit** with a simple Page Object Model (POM).

## ðŸ”„ Improvements

### Centralised WebDriver management
- Introduced a **Base** class instead of repeating driver setup/teardown in every test class.  
- Test classes now inherit from `Base`, keeping them shorter and cleaner.  

### Multi-browser support
- Added a `switch(browser)` in `Base` to allow running tests on **Chrome, Firefox, or Edge**.  
- Default is Chrome, but this makes cross-browser validation possible without rewriting tests.  

### Browser configuration improvements
- Added Chrome options (start maximised, disable password manager, etc.).  
- Easier to extend with headless runs or custom download directories.  

### Use of stable locators
- Prefer **IDs** and **CSS selectors** where possible.  
- When XPath is necessary, use attribute combinations with `and` for resilience.  

### Removed repetitive code
- Tests no longer create new driver instances manually.  
- Page Objects are used consistently for login, navigation, and CRUD actions.  

### More maintainable waits
- Reduced reliance on `Thread.Sleep` in favour of explicit waits.  
- Tests run faster and fail less often due to timing issues.  

### Cleaner Page Object usage
- Each page encapsulates its own logic (e.g., `CreateTimeRecord`, `EditTimeRecord`, `DeleteTimeRecord`).  
- Tests now express *what is being tested*, not *how Selenium executes it*.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Add keys for user authentication in `app.config`.  
- Add screenshot capture for failed tests.
- Add automation for another module.
- more optimisation with waithelpers for CRUD in Time module.
